## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am Chengkai Han, a graduate student of School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University.
- ðŸŒ± My research interests include deep learning, spatio-temporal data mining, traffic prediction and spatio-temporal representation learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am also a core developer of [LibCity](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity), which is a unified, flexible and comprehensive traffic prediction library. It provides researchers with a credibly experimental tool and a convenient development framework. Welcome to visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity) and [website](https://libcity.ai) for more details. We also publish a [full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14343) titled *LibCity: A Unified Library Towards Efficient and Comprehensive Urban Spatial-Temporal Prediction*. Statistics: [![LibCity](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/LibCity?style=social)](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/LibCity?style=social) [![fork](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/LibCity/Bigscity-Libcity?style=social)](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity/network/members).
- ðŸ˜„ We rank 11th in the Regular track of the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting Challenge. The paper has been accepted for [ACM SIGKDD Workshop 2022](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/introduction) conference.

- ðŸ˜„ Our paper titled *PDFormer: Propagation Delay-aware Dynamic Long-range Transformer for Traffic Flow Prediction* has been accepted for the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence [AAAI 2023](https://aaai-23.aaai.org/) conference (CCF-A, Acceptance rate is 19.6%). [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07945) [code](https://github.com/BUAABIGSCity/PDFormer)
- ðŸ˜„ We publish a paper titled *Unified Data Management and Comprehensive Performance Evaluation for Urban Spatial-Temporal Prediction [Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark]*, including (1) a Unified Storage Format for urban spatial-temporal data, (2) a Technical Development Roadmap for urban spatial-temporal prediction models, (3) Extensive Experiments and Performance Evaluation using 18 models and 20 datasets.
