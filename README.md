## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am Chengkai Han, a graduate student of School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University.
- ðŸŒ± My research interests include deep learning, spatio-temporal data mining, traffic prediction and federated learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am also a member of [LibCity](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity), which is a unified, flexible and comprehensive traffic prediction library. It provides researchers with a credibly experimental tool and a convenient development framework. Welcome to visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity) and [website](https://libcity.ai) for more details.
- ðŸ˜„ We rank 11th in the Regular track of the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting Challenge. The paper has been accepted for [ACM SIGKDD Workshop 2022](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/introduction) conference.
